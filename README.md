-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The colors, reflecting branded whisky lable and from the representative front photograph are used. Mainly greys with the bluish tint and, for the contrast rish yellow, orange and dark broeny-red .
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Merriweather and Open Sans fonts are the main fonts used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Merriweather font was specifically created for the screens and easy to read in any forms and sizes. It gives a nice clean, elegant feel, but still feels modern and dynamic. Open Sans is chosen as one of the best suggested matches.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Image was provided by the client and were specialy made for this brand. Image represent a whicky bottle and was used as a logo for the header for this project. As image itself is striking, it also provided a base of the site's color scheme.
*   ### Wireframes

    -   as a still very junior developer, i chose to mockup website with the paper and pen. (as still need to work out how to attach wireframe files to the github...)
